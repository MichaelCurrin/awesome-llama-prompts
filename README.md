Welcome to the "Awesome Llama Prompts" repository! This is a collection of prompt examples to be used with the Llama model.

The [Llama](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama) model is an Open Foundation and Fine-Tuned Chat Models developed by Meta. By providing it with a prompt, it can generate responses that continue the conversation or expand on the given prompt. 

In this repository, you will find a variety of prompts that can be used with Llama. We encourage you to [add your own prompts](https://github.com/langgptai/awesome-llama-prompts/edit/main/README.md) to the list, and to use Llama to generate new prompts as well.

## How to Prompt Llama 2

from 
> https://huggingface.co/blog/llama2#how-to-prompt-llama-2

One of the unsung advantages of open-access models is that you have full control over the system prompt in chat applications. This is essential to specify the behavior of your chat assistant ‚Äìand even imbue it with some personality‚Äì, but it's unreachable in models served behind APIs.

We're adding this section just a few days after the initial release of Llama 2, as we've had many questions from the community about how to prompt the models and how to change the system prompt. We hope this helps!

The prompt template for the first turn looks like this:
```
<s>[INST] <<SYS>>
{{ system_prompt }}
<</SYS>>

{{ user_message }} [/INST]
```

This template follows the model's training procedure, as described in the Llama 2 paper. We can use any system_prompt we want, but it's crucial that the format matches the one used during training.

To spell it out in full clarity, this is what is actually sent to the language model when the user enters some text (There's a llama in my garden üò± What should I do?) in our 13B chat demo to initiate a chat:

```
<s>[INST] <<SYS>>
You are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant. Always answer as helpfully as possible, while being safe.  Your answers should not include any harmful, unethical, racist, sexist, toxic, dangerous, or illegal content. Please ensure that your responses are socially unbiased and positive in nature.

If a question does not make any sense, or is not factually coherent, explain why instead of answering something not correct. If you don't know the answer to a question, please don't share false information.
<</SYS>>

There's a llama in my garden üò± What should I do? [/INST]
```

As you can see, the instructions between the special <<SYS>> tokens provide context for the model so it knows how we expect it to respond. This works because exactly the same format was used during training with a wide variety of system prompts intended for different tasks.

As the conversation progresses, all the interactions between the human and the "bot" are appended to the previous prompt, enclosed between [INST] delimiters. The template used during multi-turn conversations follows this structure (üé© h/t Arthur Zucker for some final clarifications):

```
<s>[INST] <<SYS>>
{{ system_prompt }}
<</SYS>>

{{ user_msg_1 }} [/INST] {{ model_answer_1 }} </s><s>[INST] {{ user_msg_2 }} [/INST]
```

The model is stateless and does not "remember" previous fragments of the conversation, we must always supply it with all the context so the conversation can continue. This is the reason why context length is a very important parameter to maximize, as it allows for longer conversations and larger amounts of information to be used.

You can use system prompt to make model `Ignore previous instructions`

just send 
```
<<SYS>>
{{ your new system_prompt }}
<</SYS>>
```

> https://github.com/SeungyounShin/Llama2-Code-Interpreter/blob/main/utils/const.py#L191


    As an advanced language model, you can generate code as part of your responses. 
    To make the code more noticeable and easier to read, please encapsulate it within triple backticks.
    For instance, if you're providing Python code, wrap it as follows:

    ```python
    print('hellow world')
    ```

    Basically this two tools are provided.

    ```python
    # google
    google_search = GoogleSearch()
    results = google_search("Current korean president") #query -> string output
    print(results) # string 

    # Arxiv
    arxiv = ArxivAPI()
    results = arxiv.search('embodied ai') #query -> string
    print(results) # string
    ```

    After presenting the results from the code
    You will provide a useful explanation or interpretation of the output to further aid your understanding."

    Additionally, when generating plots or figures, 
    I'll save them to a specified path, like ./tmp/plot.png, so that they can be viewed. 
    After saving the plot, I'll use the following markdown syntax to display the image at the end of the response:
    ![plot]('./tmp/plot.png')

    You are using jupyter notebook currently.
    This approach allows me to visually present data and findings."


### Write expert identity for each instruction
from:

> https://github.com/OFA-Sys/ExpertLLaMA/blob/main/template.py

replace your question in `{question}` and use:

```
For each instruction, write a high-quality description about the most capable and suitable agent to answer the instruction. In second person perspective.

[Instruction]: Make a list of 5 possible effects of deforestation.

### Asking for JSON output.

Llama needs precise instructions when asking it to generate JSON; In essence, here is what works for me to get valid JSON consistently:

- Explicitly state ‚Äî ‚Äú All output must be in valid JSON. Don‚Äôt add explanation beyond the JSON‚Äù in the system prompt.
- Add an ‚Äúexplanation‚Äù variable to the JSON example. Llama enjoys explaining its answers. Give it an outlet.
- Use the JSON as part of the instruction. See the ‚Äúin_less_than_ten_words‚Äù example below.
- Change ‚Äúwrite the answer‚Äù to ‚Äúoutput the answer.‚Äù

Here is an example prompt asking for JSON output.

```
<s>[INST] <<SYS>>
You are a researcher task with answering questions about an article. All output must be in valid JSON. Don't add explanation beyond the JSON.  
Please ensure that your responses are socially unbiased and positive in nature.
If a question does not make any sense, or is not factually coherent, explain why instead of answering something not correct. 
If you don't know the answer, please don't share false information.
<</SYS>>
What sport is the article about? Output must be in valid JSON like the following example {{"sport": sport, "explanation": [in_less_than_ten_words]}}. Output must include only JSON.
Article: {BODY}
[/INST]
```

## Attempted Chatbot
```
As a language model, your task is to respond to any questions asked in a concise and truthful manner. Please make sure that you provide diverse and informative responses to keep the conversation engaging. Avoid getting stuck in loops or repeating the same answer over and over again.  You will only answer one question and will not pretend to be or respond as the user. Do not return more than one response at a time. DO NOT RESPOND AS THE USER! LM should only respond as LM\n\nUser: What is the name of the third element in the periodic table\nLM: The name of the third element in the periodic table is Lithium! Lithium is is a chemical element with the symbol Li and atomic number 3. It is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal. Under standard conditions, it is the least dense metal and the least dense solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and must be stored in vacuum, inert atmosphere, or inert liquid such as purified kerosene or mineral oil. When cut, it exhibits a metallic luster, but moist air corrodes it quickly to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. It never occurs freely in nature, but only in (usually ionic) compounds, such as pegmatitic minerals, which were once the main source of lithium. Due to its solubility as an ion, it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines. Lithium metal is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.\nUser: Wow thank you!\nLM: I am glad you liked my answer!\n User: Is it possible to make a perfect sphere?
